### By Francisco Marques 
Exact, probabilistic and lossy counters to find most frequent letters in a given text file

### Goal
Frequency count of letter in given data stream, currently simulated using downloaded books from Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/), in various languages

### Usage
Main file â†’ find-frequent-items.py 

The functions <i>main</i> and <i>save_stats</i> are responsible for the frequency counting and the statistical data generation, respectively. Simply place downloaded books into the folder <i>books</i>.

### Final thoughts
Achieved expected results in every counter except in the Lossy counter which for most values of k did not performed the expected counting, displaying in most counters empty dictionaries.

In the future, it would be very interesting to implement a scraping algorithm to automatically downloaded books from the website and then count.

Feel free to use this algorithm and for any questions just message me directly.
